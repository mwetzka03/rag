ADDITIONAL_LLM_INSTRUCTION=The following sections contain relevant context information retrieved through RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) from the knowledge base. Use these RAG contexts as supportive references, but primarily base your response on the BPMN diagram provided. Combine insights from both the BPMN diagram and the RAG context to create a comprehensive and accurate text description. # Additional instruction to append for the LLM
